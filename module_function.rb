# Creates module functions for the named methods. These functions may be called with
# the module as a receiver, and also become available as instance methods to classes
# that mix in the module. Module functions are copies of the original, and so may be
# changed independently. The instance-method versions are made private. If used with
# no arguments, subsequently defined methods become module functions.
