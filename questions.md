  1) Is there a way to make a private class constant
     https://github.com/fanchenpai/playground/blob/master/class_var.rb (line 12, 25 doesn't work as expected)

  2) Why can't I assign value to instance variables at very top of class like we create class variables
     https://github.com/fanchenpai/playground/blob/master/inst_var.rb (line 2, 18)

  3) module_function (will this be covered in any future lectures?_
     https://github.com/fanchenpai/playground/blob/master/module_function.rb
     - At line 68, why the output is not the new one?
     - At line 69, why does this work, the new definition of one method is after the Object c
       was created. Don't Ruby care about the sequence of codes?
